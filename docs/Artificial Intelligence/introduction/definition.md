# Definition

## What is AI?

- Area of computer  science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and reacts like humans
- Has become an essential part of the technology industry
- Has highly technical and specialized research associated with it

## Goals of AI

- **To create expert systems:** The systems which exhibit intelligent behaviour, learn, demonstrate, explain and advice its users
- **To implement human intelligence in machines:** Creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans

## Branches of AI

### Machine Learning (ML)

- ML is a method where the target is defined and the steps to reach that target are learned by the machine itself by training
- Example: to identify a simple object such as an apple or orange
- The target is achieved by showing multiple pictures of object and thereby allowing the machine to define the steps to identify it like an apple or an orange.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- NLP is the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software
- Example: e-mail spam detection which has improved the mail system

### Vision

- Machine vision captures and analyses visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion, and digital signal processing

### Robotics

- Robotics is a field of engineering focused on the design and manufacturing of robots
- Robots are used where the takss are difficult for humans to perform
- For example, car assemply lines, in hospitals, office cleaner, servin
