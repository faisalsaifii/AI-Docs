# Future of AI

## Evolution of AI

### Beginning of AI (1943)

- The concept of AI began around 1943
- AI is not limited to the computer sciences disciplines, but can be seen in various other areas

### AI knowledge-based expert systems (1970)

- An AI system often uses a rule-based system to capture knowledge in the form of if-then statements or as decision trees

### Machine Learning (1998)

- There are two types of machine learning:
  - **Formal:** The formal type of machine learning is a computer program that learns from experience in respect to some task and increases performance based on that experience
  - **Informal:** The informal involves giving computers the ability to learn without explicitly programming the capability

### Supervised Learning (2004)

- The supervised learning is based on giving the correct answers and having the computer mapping inputs to outputs
- For Example:
  - **Spam Filters:** Software is trained to learn and distinguish between spam and non-spam messages (For example, e-mail filters).
  - **Facial Recognition:** It is used by cameras to focus and via photo editing software to tag people (For example, Facebook)

### Unsupervised Learning (2010)

- Unsupervised learning is the reverse of supervised learning where the correct answers are unknown. For example:
  - **Clustering Algorithm:** Used to find patterns in datasets and then group that data into different coherent clusters
  - **Market Segmentation:** Targeting customers based on regions, likes, dislikes, when the consumer makes purchases, etc. This is considered targeted marketing.

### Genetic Programming (2010)

- Genetic Programming is an idea that uses evolutionay process to improve algorithms

### Future of AI (2019 onwards)

- There are many challenges in mimicking human intelligence.
- Humans acquire common senses that are intuitive but hard to reason rationally.
- For example, the colour of a blue car is blue
