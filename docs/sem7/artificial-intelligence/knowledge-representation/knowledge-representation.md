# Knowledge Representation

## Desirable Properties of a Good Knowledge Representation System

### 1. Representational Adequacy

Ability to represent all kinds of knowledge that are needed in that domain

### 2. Inferential Adequacy

Ability to manipulate the representational structures in such a way as to derive new structures corresponding to new knowledge inferred from old

### 3. Inferential Efficiency

Ability to incorporate into the knowledge structure, additional information that can be used to focus the attention of the inference mechanisms in the most promising directions

### 4. Acquisitional Efficiency

The ability to acquire new information easily. The simplest case involves direct insertion, by a person, of new knowledge into the database. Ideally, the program itself would be able to control knowledge acquisition.
